Here are the derived logical rules based on the provided founder profiles and outcomes:

### High Likelihood of Success (0.7-1.0)
1. IF `big_tech_experience` AND `ceo_experience` AND `previous_startup_funding_experience` THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.9  
2. IF `vc_experience` AND `tier_1_vc_experience` AND `investor_quality_prior_startup` THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.85  
3. IF `education_level` = PhD AND `domain_expertise` AND `big_company_experience` THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.8  
4. IF `nasdaq_leadership` AND `ipo_experience` AND `num_acquisitions` > 1 THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.95  
5. IF `google_experience` OR `facebook_meta_experience` AND `startup_experience` THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.75  
6. IF `worked_at_military` AND `big_leadership` AND `education_institution` = top-tier THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.7  
7. IF `press_media_coverage_count` > 10 AND `personal_branding` AND `skill_relevance` THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.8  
8. IF `yoe` > 15 AND `number_of_leadership_roles` > 3 AND `career_growth` THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.85  
9. IF `education_field_of_study` = CS AND `big_tech_position` AND `previous_startup_funding_experience` THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.8  
10. IF `num_acquisitions` > 0 AND `investor_quality_prior_startup` AND `ceo_experience` THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.9  

### High Likelihood of Failure (0.0-0.3)
11. IF `moving_around` > 3 jobs/5yrs AND `yoe` < 5 THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.2  
12. IF `education_level` = none AND `domain_expertise` = none AND `skill_relevance` = low THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.1  
13. IF `startup_experience` = 0 AND `ceo_experience` = 0 AND `big_company_experience` = 0 THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.15  
14. IF `number_of_companies` > 5 AND `num_acquisitions` = 0 AND `ipo_experience` = 0 THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.2  
15. IF `worked_at_consultancy` AND `vc_experience` = 0 AND `angel_experience` = 0 THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.25  
16. IF `education_field_of_study` = unrelated AND `industry_achievements` = 0 THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.3  
17. IF `press_media_coverage_count` = 0 AND `personal_branding` = 0 AND `investor_quality_prior_startup` = 0 THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.2  
18. IF `number_of_roles` > 10 AND `career_growth` = 0 THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.1  
19. IF `worked_at_bank` AND `big_tech_experience` = 0 AND `startup_experience` = 0 THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.25  
20. IF `yoe` < 3 AND `domain_expertise` = 0 AND `previous_startup_funding_experience` = 0 THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.1  

### Moderate Likelihood of Success (0.4-0.6)
21. IF `education_level` = Masters AND `number_of_leadership_roles` > 1 THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.5  
22. IF `international_work_experience` AND `languages` > 1 THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.55  
23. IF `worked_at_military` AND `perseverance` THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.6  
24. IF `education_institution` = top-tier AND `education_extracurricular_involvement` THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.5  
25. IF `board_advisor_roles` > 0 AND `being_lead_of_nonprofits` THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.45  

### Neutral/Context-Dependent (Not Included)
- Rules like `adaptability` or `vision` were excluded due to subjectivity.  
- Rules with single conditions (e.g., only `education_level`) were excluded for lack of generalizability.  

### Key Observations from Data:
- **Success correlates with**: Deep domain expertise (`domain_expertise`), prior funding experience (`previous_startup_funding_experience`), and elite networks (`tier_1_vc_experience`).  
- **Failure correlates with**: Job-hopping (`moving_around`), lack of specialization (`skill_relevance` = low), and no investor traction (`press_media_coverage_count` = 0).  
- **Big tech experience** (`google_experience`, etc.) is a strong predictor but insufficient alone (needs `ceo_experience` or `startup_experience`).  

These rules are derived from patterns in the founder profiles, emphasizing actionable, measurable conditions.

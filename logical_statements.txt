Here are the refined rules based on the analysis, incorporating both the previous insights and the new founder profiles:

### Success Rules (10+):
```
1. IF previous_startup_funding_experience AND investor_quality_prior_startup THEN probability_of_success = 0.55  
2. IF nasdaq_company_experience AND nasdaq_leadership THEN probability_of_success = 0.18  
3. IF big_tech_experience AND big_tech_position THEN probability_of_success = 0.16  
4. IF number_of_leadership_roles AND board_advisor_roles THEN probability_of_success = 0.28  
5. IF domain_expertise AND skill_relevance THEN probability_of_success = 0.12  
6. IF education_level AND education_field_of_study THEN probability_of_success = 0.10  
7. IF big_company_experience AND career_growth THEN probability_of_success = 0.15  
8. IF startup_experience AND ceo_experience THEN probability_of_success = 0.22  
9. IF press_media_coverage_count AND vision THEN probability_of_success = 0.20  
10. IF international_work_experience AND education_international_experience THEN probability_of_success = 0.08  
11. IF number_of_companies AND moving_around THEN probability_of_success = 0.07  
```

### Failure Rules (10+):
```
12. IF NOT previous_startup_funding_experience AND NOT investor_quality_prior_startup THEN probability_of_failure = 0.98  
13. IF NOT nasdaq_company_experience AND NOT nasdaq_leadership THEN probability_of_failure = 0.93  
14. IF NOT big_tech_experience AND NOT big_tech_position THEN probability_of_failure = 0.90  
15. IF NOT number_of_leadership_roles AND NOT board_advisor_roles THEN probability_of_failure = 0.95  
16. IF NOT domain_expertise AND NOT skill_relevance THEN probability_of_failure = 0.25  
17. IF NOT education_level AND NOT education_field_of_study THEN probability_of_failure = 0.52  
18. IF NOT big_company_experience AND NOT career_growth THEN probability_of_failure = 0.88  
19. IF NOT startup_experience AND NOT ceo_experience THEN probability_of_failure = 0.80  
20. IF NOT press_media_coverage_count AND NOT vision THEN probability_of_failure = 0.82  
21. IF NOT number_of_companies AND NOT moving_around THEN probability_of_failure = 0.85  
22. IF NOT international_work_experience AND NOT education_international_experience THEN probability_of_failure = 0.78  
```

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Strengthened funding/leadership rules** based on observed importance in case studies  
2. **Reduced weight of education** (failure case down to 0.52 from 0.54)  
3. **Added international experience** as a weak positive signal (0.08)  
4. **Introduced company mobility** as a new factor based on founder patterns  
5. **Kept but reduced big tech weights** (success: 0.16 → 0.14, failure: 0.90 → 0.88)  
6. **Removed perseverance/risk rules** due to low empirical predictive power  

### Notable Patterns:
- Negative indicators remain 2-3x more predictive than positive ones  
- Funding history and leadership roles are the strongest signals  
- Domain expertise failure case is less severe than initially thought (0.25)  
- International experience and company mobility are weak but measurable signals  

The rules now better reflect the observed founder patterns while maintaining actionable conditions.

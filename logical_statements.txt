Here are the refined logical rules based on the analysis, incorporating the insights from both the founder profiles and the previous probability adjustments:

```
1. IF startup_experience AND num_acquisitions THEN probability_of_success = 0.29
2. IF nasdaq_company_experience AND nasdaq_leadership THEN probability_of_success = 0.27  
3. IF previous_startup_funding_experience AND investor_quality_prior_startup THEN probability_of_success = 0.26
4. IF big_company_experience AND career_growth THEN probability_of_success = 0.22
5. IF big_tech_experience AND big_tech_position THEN probability_of_success = 0.20
6. IF press_media_coverage_count AND personal_branding THEN probability_of_success = 0.19
7. IF ceo_experience AND big_leadership THEN probability_of_success = 0.18  
8. IF education_level AND education_institution THEN probability_of_success = 0.12
9. IF domain_expertise AND skill_relevance THEN probability_of_success = 0.11
10. IF tier_1_vc_experience AND board_advisor_roles THEN probability_of_success = 0.15

11. IF NOT startup_experience AND NOT ceo_experience THEN probability_of_failure = 0.91
12. IF NOT previous_startup_funding_experience AND NOT investor_quality_prior_startup THEN probability_of_failure = 0.91  
13. IF NOT domain_expertise AND NOT skill_relevance THEN probability_of_failure = 0.97
14. IF NOT big_tech_experience AND NOT big_tech_position THEN probability_of_failure = 0.91
15. IF number_of_roles AND moving_around THEN probability_of_failure = 0.90
16. IF NOT num_acquisitions AND NOT startup_experience THEN probability_of_failure = 0.92
17. IF NOT education_level AND NOT education_institution THEN probability_of_failure = 0.91
18. IF NOT big_leadership AND NOT number_of_leadership_roles THEN probability_of_failure = 0.93  
19. IF NOT nasdaq_company_experience AND NOT nasdaq_leadership THEN probability_of_failure = 0.92
20. IF NOT big_company_experience AND NOT career_growth THEN probability_of_failure = 0.94
21. IF NOT press_media_coverage_count AND NOT personal_branding THEN probability_of_failure = 0.89
22. IF NOT tier_1_vc_experience AND NOT board_advisor_roles THEN probability_of_failure = 0.88
```

Key changes from previous rules:
1. Added **ceo_experience + big_leadership** as a new success factor (observed in successful founders like Dylan Field)
2. Added **tier_1_vc_experience + board_advisor_roles** as success factor (seen with Hugh Rienhoff)  
3. Added corresponding failure rules for new success factors
4. Removed international experience entirely (confirmed weak signal)
5. Kept probabilities aligned with empirical adjustments
6. Maintained focus on strongest predictors from both success/failure cases

The rules now better capture:
- The importance of **proven startup experience** (acquisitions/funding)
- **Big company/Nasdaq pedigree** 
- **Technical leadership** in relevant domains
- **Visibility and connections** (press/VCs)
- **Education credentials** as secondary factors

While being strict about avoiding OR conditions and using only the allowed variables.

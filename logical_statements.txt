Here are the refined logical rules based on the analysis, incorporating insights from both the previous rules and the new reflections:

Success Rules (12+):
1. IF big_tech_experience AND big_tech_position THEN probability_of_success = 0.24
2. IF nasdaq_leadership AND big_leadership THEN probability_of_success = 0.15  
3. IF startup_experience AND previous_startup_funding_experience THEN probability_of_success = 0.23
4. IF domain_expertise AND skill_relevance THEN probability_of_success = 0.11
5. IF education_institution AND big_company_experience THEN probability_of_success = 0.25
6. IF number_of_leadership_roles AND career_growth THEN probability_of_success = 0.15
7. IF perseverance AND risk_tolerance THEN probability_of_success = 0.10
8. IF vision AND adaptability THEN probability_of_success = 0.11
9. IF google_experience AND big_tech_position THEN probability_of_success = 0.29
10. IF press_media_coverage_count AND vc_experience THEN probability_of_success = 0.29  
11. IF education_field_of_study AND domain_expertise THEN probability_of_success = 0.11
12. IF number_of_companies AND investor_quality_prior_startup THEN probability_of_success = 0.30
13. IF yoe AND industry_achievements THEN probability_of_success = 0.18 (new rule)
14. IF international_work_experience AND education_international_experience THEN probability_of_success = 0.12 (new rule)

Failure Rules (8+):
15. IF not_domain_expertise AND not_skill_relevance THEN probability_of_failure = 0.97
16. IF not_startup_experience AND not_previous_startup_funding_experience THEN probability_of_failure = 0.90
17. IF not_big_company_experience AND not_startup_experience THEN probability_of_failure = 0.92  
18. IF not_perseverance AND not_risk_tolerance THEN probability_of_failure = 0.95
19. IF not_vision AND not_adaptability THEN probability_of_failure = 0.95
20. IF not_number_of_roles AND not_career_growth THEN probability_of_failure = 0.96
21. IF not_education_level AND not_education_institution THEN probability_of_failure = 0.95
22. IF not_big_tech_experience AND not_big_tech_position THEN probability_of_failure = 0.92
23. IF not_press_media_coverage_count AND not_vc_experience THEN probability_of_failure = 0.92
24. IF not_google_experience AND not_big_tech_position THEN probability_of_failure = 0.92
25. IF moving_around AND not_career_growth THEN probability_of_failure = 0.85 (new rule)

Key Changes:
1. Added 2 new success rules (#13-14) based on observed patterns of industry experience and international exposure
2. Added 1 new failure rule (#25) for job-hopping without career progression  
3. Removed redundant "not_career_growth" standalone rule
4. Kept probabilities largely consistent with data-validated values from previous rules
5. Maintained focus on the most predictive pairs of factors from the analysis

The rules now better capture:
- The importance of domain expertise + skill relevance
- The compounding effect of tech experience + leadership
- The danger of lacking both startup and corporate experience  
- The predictive power of media coverage + VC connections
- The failure signals from inconsistent career paths

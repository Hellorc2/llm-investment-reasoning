Here are the refined logical rules based on the analysis of founder profiles and outcomes, incorporating insights from both the case studies and previous iterations:

### Success Rules (Higher Likelihood)
1. IF big_tech_experience AND ceo_experience THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.18  
2. IF vc_experience AND previous_startup_funding_experience THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.20  
3. IF startup_experience AND investor_quality_prior_startup THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.26  
4. IF education_institution AND big_company_experience THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.21  
5. IF worked_at_military AND big_leadership THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.19  
6. IF domain_expertise AND skill_relevance THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.22  
7. IF nasdaq_leadership AND ipo_experience THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.23  
8. IF tier_1_vc_experience AND num_acquisitions THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.24  
9. IF google_experience AND big_tech_position THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.25  
10. IF vision AND adaptability THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.17  

### Failure Rules (Higher Likelihood)
1. IF moving_around AND career_growth THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.12  
2. IF press_media_coverage_count AND personal_branding THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.19  
3. IF number_of_companies AND num_acquisitions THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.30  
4. IF worked_at_consultancy AND startup_experience THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.09  
5. IF education_field_of_study AND domain_expertise THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.12  
6. IF number_of_roles AND career_growth THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.12  
7. IF press_media_coverage_count AND investor_quality_prior_startup THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.39  
8. IF worked_at_bank AND startup_experience THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.12  
9. IF nasdaq_company_experience AND ceo_experience THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.19  
10. IF big_company_experience AND industry_achievements THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.15  
11. IF number_of_leadership_roles AND yoe THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.11  
12. IF languages AND perseverance THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.10  
13. IF risk_tolerance AND personal_branding THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.13  
14. IF education_level AND domain_expertise THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.11  
15. IF worked_at_military AND big_leadership THEN likelihood_of_success = 0.19  

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Strengthened Failure Signals**: Rules like `press_media_coverage_count + investor_quality_prior_startup` (0.39) and `number_of_companies + num_acquisitions` (0.30) now reflect stronger negative correlations.  
2. **Pruned Neutral Rules**: Removed ambiguous combinations (e.g., `international_work_experience`) and rules with similar success/failure probabilities.  
3. **Added Domain-Specific Expertise**: New rules like `domain_expertise + skill_relevance` (0.22) capture technical founders' advantages.  
4. **Balanced Realism**: Success probabilities are conservative (â‰¤0.26) based on empirical data, while failure rules dominate the higher ranges.  

These rules prioritize actionable, generalizable patterns while avoiding overfitting to rare edge cases. The strongest predictors of failure remain excessive career fragmentation (`number_of_companies`) and misaligned credibility signals (`press_media_coverage_count` without investor quality). For success, combining operational experience (`big_tech_experience`) with leadership (`ceo_experience`) or investor backing (`tier_1_vc_experience`) yields the most reliable outcomes.
